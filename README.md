# ARTIFACT FINE GOODS E-COMMERCE WEBSITE
This project is a fictional e-commerce website geared towards the sale of antique items. This was built by myself over the course of two weeks as a personal project. I used this site to increase my understanding of performing full CRUD operations in a full stack context. Visitors to the website can login using Auth0 for server-side authentication, they can then shop through a list of products being pulled from my database, add items to a shopping cart, edit their own unique user profile that is tied to their login credentials, and delete items from their cart. Also, I implemented the Stripe payment API to simulate payment handling.

For the styling and design of the website, everything was done by hand from mocking up the site using wireframing to choosing the colors and layout. The site design was then coded in CSS using SASS as a preprocessor to work more efficiently.

## Technologies
* **React** - Model View Controller JavaScript library
* **Redux** - Used in conjunction with React to allow for access to a centralized state across my components
* **Node.js** - Server-side JavaScript environment
* **Express** - Server
* **Massive** - Used to connect to PostgreSQL database
* **Passport** - Allows for server side user authentication with Auth0
* **Sass** - CSS Preprocessor to make code more DRY utilizing mixins and variables
